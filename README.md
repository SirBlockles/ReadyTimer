# Ready Timer
SourceMod plugin for TF2 that adds a timer to the HUD showing how long a team has been readied. No longer will a team ready and wonder "How long have we been rupped? Has it been 15 minutes?"

Timer also is persistent and only resets when a team unreadies or the game has begun; if the enemy team readies then unreadies the timer will stop updating its display during the countdown but will have been keeping time and show back up when the other team unreadies.

Also uses your team's ready-up name instead of hard-coded RED and BLU.
